## Authorization

The components in the **Auth** directory are responsible for user authentication on the website.

User authentication is implemented using the **@web3modal library** (https://reown.com/appkit).

In addition, a standard is used that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object - **JSON Web Token (JWT)**. The JWT is generated after the user has authenticated via a Web3 wallet.
